# Project Roadmap: Self-Improving Website Cloner

This roadmap outlines the future development plans for the Self-Improving Website Cloner project, focusing on enhancing its capabilities to become a truly intelligent, self-modifying system.

## Phase 1: Foundation Consolidation (Current)

- [x] Basic website structure extraction
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Simulated VLM feedback loop
- [x] Iterative refinement process
- [x] Project documentation

## Phase 2: Real VLM Integration (Next 2-3 Months)

- [ ] Implement Puppeteer for actual screenshot capture
- [ ] Create Claude API integration for real VLM analysis
- [ ] Develop sophisticated prompt templates for different analysis types
- [ ] Build structured feedback schema for consistent implementation
- [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms

## Phase 3: Multi-Domain Expansion (3-6 Months)

- [ ] Develop domain-specific extraction patterns
- [ ] Create specialized feedback templates for different industries
- [ ] Implement domain-specific component libraries
- [ ] Add domain performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document domain adaptation process

## Phase 4: Research API Integration (6-9 Months)

- [ ] Connect to web search APIs for competitive analysis
- [ ] Implement specialized research agents
- [ ] Create knowledge database for design patterns
- [ ] Develop industry-specific best practice repositories
- [ ] Build cross-domain insight generation

## Phase 5: Self-Modification (9-12 Months)

- [ ] Implement system for analyzing own codebase
- [ ] Create performance monitoring framework
- [ ] Develop self-diagnosis capabilities
- [ ] Build automated refactoring system
- [ ] Implement gradual self-improvement processes

## Phase 6: Multi-Tool Orchestration (12+ Months)

- [ ] Integrate with specialized AI models for different tasks
- [ ] Create workflow orchestration system
- [ ] Implement task delegation framework
- [ ] Develop model selection optimization
- [ ] Build cross-model consensus mechanisms

## Long-Term Vision

Our ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous system that can:

1. **Self-Extend**: Develop its own capabilities without human intervention
2. **Self-Diagnose**: Identify and fix its own limitations and bugs
3. **Self-Specialize**: Adapt to new domains without explicit programming
4. **Self-Research**: Actively seek out and integrate new knowledge and techniques
5. **Self-Improve**: Continuously enhance its own architecture and algorithms

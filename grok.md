Here’s how to package the Claude code setup into a standalone Python script using UV, as outlined in paulw.tokyo/standalone-python-script-with-uv/. This solution creates an "easy hack .py file" that’s self-contained, portable, and includes install scripts at the top, allowing you to run multiple Claude agents for tasks like generating, reviewing, and testing code—perfect for a project like [weed.th](http://weed.th).
Overview
The goal is to create a single Python script that:
Uses UV to manage and bundle Python dependencies (e.g., requests, beautifulsoup4, flask).
Checks for and installs Node.js, npm, and the @anthropic-ai/claude-code CLI if they’re missing.
Sets up Jujutsu (JJ) for version control and workspace management.
Runs multiple Claude agents in parallel for different tasks.
This approach ensures the script is easy to run on any system, with all setup handled automatically.
Steps to Package with UV
UV simplifies dependency management and can create a standalone executable. Here’s how we’ll structure the script:
UV Dependency Management: Install Python packages needed for web scraping or app development.
Node.js and Claude Setup: Ensure Node.js and the Claude CLI are available.
JJ Integration: Set up a JJ repository with workspaces for each agent.
Agent Execution: Launch Claude agents for specific tasks.
Once the script is written, UV can package it into a single executable file.
The Standalone Script
Below is the complete Python script. Save it as claude_setup.py:
python
\#!/usr/bin/env python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def run_command(command, cwd=None, shell=False):
"""Run a shell command and handle errors."""
try:
subprocess.run(command, cwd=cwd, shell=shell, check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
print(f"Error running {command}: {e}")
sys.exit(1)

# Step 1: Install Python dependencies with UV

print("Installing Python dependencies with UV...")
run_command(\["uv", "pip", "install", "requests", "beautifulsoup4", "flask"\])

# Step 2: Check and install Node.js and npm

print("Checking for Node.js and npm...")
try:
subprocess.run(\["node", "--version"\], check=True)
subprocess.run(\["npm", "--version"\], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
print("Node.js or npm not found. Installing...")
if [os.name](http://os.name) == 'nt':  # Windows
run_command(\["winget", "install", "nodejs"\])
else:  # Linux/macOS (assumes apt-get for simplicity)
run_command(\["sudo", "apt-get", "install", "-y", "nodejs", "npm"\])

# Step 3: Install Claude code CLI globally

print("Installing @anthropic-ai/claude-code...")
run_command(\["npm", "install", "-g", "@anthropic-ai/claude-code"\])

# Step 4: Install Jujutsu (JJ) - example for Linux/macOS

print("Installing Jujutsu (JJ)...")
if [os.name](http://os.name) != 'nt':  # Adjust for Windows if needed
run_command(\["curl", "-s", "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinvonz/jj/main/install.sh>", "|", "sh"\], shell=True)
else:
print("Please install JJ manually on Windows: <https://github.com/martinvonz/jj>")
sys.exit(1)

# Step 5: Set up JJ repository and workspaces

project_dir = "my-ai-project"
print(f"Setting up JJ repository in {project_dir}...")
os.makedirs(project_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.chdir(project_dir)
run_command(\["jj", "git", "init"\])
run_command(\["jj", "workspace", "add", "codegen"\])
run_command(\["jj", "workspace", "add", "reviewer"\])
run_command(\["jj", "workspace", "add", "tester"\])

# Step 6: Run Claude agents in each workspace

print("Running Claude agents...")
run_command(\["claude", "Generate a new feature for user authentication"\], cwd="codegen", shell=True)
run_command(\["claude", "Review the code and provide feedback"\], cwd="reviewer", shell=True)
run_command(\["claude", "Write tests for the new feature"\], cwd="tester", shell=True)

print("Setup complete! Check the 'my-ai-project' directory for agent outputs.")
How to Package with UV
To turn this script into a standalone executable using UV:
Install UV:
Follow the instructions at paulw.tokyo/standalone-python-script-with-uv/ to install UV on your system (e.g., via pip install uv or a package manager).
Save the Script:
Save the code above as claude_setup.py.
Package with UV:
Run the following command in your terminal:
bash
uv build --script claude_setup.py
This creates a standalone executable (e.g., claude_setup) with all Python dependencies bundled.
Run the Executable:
On Linux/macOS:
bash
./claude_setup
On Windows:
cmd
claude_setup.exe
What the Script Does
Dependencies: Installs Python packages (requests, beautifulsoup4, flask) with UV.
Node.js/npm: Checks for Node.js and npm, installing them if absent (uses winget on Windows, apt-get on Linux/macOS).
Claude CLI: Installs @anthropic-ai/claude-code globally via npm.
JJ Setup: Installs JJ and sets up a repository with three workspaces: codegen, reviewer, and tester.
Agents: Runs Claude agents in each workspace with example tasks (customize these as needed).
Notes and Customization
Platform Support: The script assumes apt-get for Linux/macOS and winget for Windows. Adjust installation commands for other package managers (e.g., brew on macOS).
JJ on Windows: The JJ install is Linux/macOS-focused. For Windows, install JJ manually or modify the script with a Windows-specific installer.
Task Customization: Replace the example claude commands with tasks specific to your [weed.th](http://weed.th) project (e.g., "Generate a homepage layout").
Error Handling: The script includes basic error checking; enhance it with try-except blocks for robustness if needed.
Why UV?
UV ensures the script is portable by bundling Python dependencies into a single file, eliminating the need for users to manually install packages. Combined with automated Node.js, npm, and JJ setup, this meets your request for a self-contained solution.
Final Output
After running, you’ll find a my-ai-project directory with three workspaces (codegen, reviewer, tester), each containing outputs from the Claude agents. Use this as a starting point for your project, tweaking agent tasks as needed.

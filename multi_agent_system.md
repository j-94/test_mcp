# Multi-Agent System for Website Cloning and Improvement

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural rewrite of the Firecrawl MCP system to a multi-agent approach for website cloning and iterative improvement. The new system utilizes specialized agents working in concert to provide more robust functionality, better error handling, and improved scalability, packaged as a standalone Python script using UV. The system now integrates ForeverVM sandboxes for secure code execution.

## Packaging and Installation

The entire system is packaged into a self-contained Python script that handles:

1. **UV Dependency Management**
   - Automatic installation of Python dependencies
   - Bundling of all requirements into a single executable
   - Cross-platform compatibility

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js and npm installation checks and automation
   - Claude CLI (@anthropic-ai/claude-code) setup
   - Jujutsu (JJ) version control system integration

3. **Workspace Management**
   - Automatic creation of agent workspaces
   - Environment isolation per agent
   - Parallel execution configuration

### Installation Process

The system is distributed as a single executable that:
1. Self-checks for required dependencies
2. Installs missing components automatically
3. Sets up isolated workspaces for each agent
4. Configures communication channels between agents

## Architecture

The multi-agent system will consist of the following specialized agents:

### 1. Crawler Agent
- **Responsibility**: Website structure extraction and cloning
- **Capabilities**:
  - Advanced DOM traversal and extraction
  - Respecting robots.txt and ethical crawling practices
  - Handling JS-heavy websites and SPAs
  - Screenshot capture for visual reference
- **Output**: Structured representation of website (JSON, HTML, CSS)

### 2. Analysis Agent
- **Responsibility**: Analyzing website structure and design patterns
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifying key UI components and patterns
  - Recognizing responsive design breakpoints
  - Cataloging design system elements (colors, typography, spacing)
  - Identifying accessibility concerns
- **Output**: Design system documentation and component library

### 3. Implementation Agent
- **Responsibility**: Converting extracted structure to working code
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generating semantic HTML
  - Creating optimized CSS
  - Implementing basic interactivity
  - Setting up development environment
- **Output**: Working implementation with separated concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)

### 4. Feedback Agent
- **Responsibility**: Capturing and analyzing VLM feedback
- **Capabilities**:
  - Comparing snapshots of different versions
  - Generating structured improvement suggestions
  - Prioritizing changes based on impact
  - Tracking implemented vs. pending changes
- **Output**: Structured feedback and prioritized improvement plan

### 5. Orchestrator Agent
- **Responsibility**: Coordinating all other agents and managing workflow
- **Capabilities**:
  - Handling agent communication
  - Managing execution flow and dependencies
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Progress tracking and reporting
- **Output**: System status, logs, and completion reports

```

## Improvements Over Current System

1. **Fault Tolerance**: If one agent fails, others can continue their work
2. **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on its core competency
3. **Parallel Processing**: Agents can work simultaneously where appropriate
4. **Better Validation**: Cross-checking between agent outputs ensures quality
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Dedicated error recovery mechanisms per agent
6. **Configurability**: Each agent can be tuned independently
7. **Extensibility**: New agents can be added to the system without major refactoring
8. **Secure Execution**: ForeverVM sandboxes for safely running generated code
9. **Isolated Testing**: Implementation and feedback testing in secure environments

## Running the System

To use the system:

1. Download the standalone executable
2. Run it with appropriate permissions
3. The script will:
   - Check and install dependencies
   - Set up agent workspaces
   - Initialize the multi-agent system
   - Begin the website cloning process

## Technical Specifications

### Execution Environment

The multi-agent system runs in a Python environment with the following requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- UV for dependency management and packaging
- Node.js v16+ (auto-installed if missing)
- Redis for message queue and state persistence
- Jujutsu (JJ) for version control (auto-installed)
- ForeverVM for secure code execution sandbox

### ForeverVM Integration

The system integrates ForeverVM to provide secure, isolated sandboxes for running agent-generated code:

```javascript
{
  "forevervm": {
    "purpose": "Secure, isolated execution of agent-generated code",
    "integration_points": {
      "implementation_agent": "Execute and test generated implementations",
      "feedback_agent": "Validate code against requirements",
      "crawler_agent": "Run extraction scripts in isolated environment"
    },
    "security_features": {
      "isolation": "Complete separation from host system",
      "resource_limits": "Configurable CPU and memory restrictions",
      "network_control": "Configurable network access permissions"
    },
    "configuration": "Managed via orchestrator's forevervm_config.json"
  }
}
```

### Standalone Script Structure

```python
{
  "script_components": {
    "dependency_management": "UV-based package installation",
    "environment_setup": "Node.js, npm, Claude CLI installation",
    "workspace_creation": "JJ repository and workspace setup",
    "agent_execution": "Parallel agent process management",
    "sandbox_management": "ForeverVM integration and configuration"
  },
  "packaging": {
    "format": "Single executable via UV",
    "platforms": ["Windows", "Linux", "macOS"],
    "dependencies": "Auto-bundled via UV",
    "security": "ForeverVM SDK for sandbox execution"
  }
}
```

### Agent Communication Protocol

Agents will communicate using a standardized message format:

```javascript
{
  "message_id": "uuid-string",
  "source_agent": "agent-name",
  "destination_agent": "agent-name",
  "message_type": "request|response|notification|error",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "priority": 0-10,
  "payload": {
    // Message-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    // Additional context information
  }
}
```

### Agent State Management

Each agent will maintain its own state, but the orchestrator will have access to a global state for coordination:

```javascript
{
  "agent_states": {
    "crawler": "idle|working|complete|error",
    "analysis": "idle|working|complete|error",
    "implementation": "idle|working|complete|error",
    "feedback": "idle|working|complete|error"
  },
  "project_state": "initializing|crawling|analyzing|implementing|feedback|complete",
  "current_iteration": 0,
  "error_states": {},
  "completion_percentage": 0-100
}
```

## Conclusion

This multi-agent rewrite, packaged as a standalone Python script using UV, significantly enhances the capabilities of the Firecrawl MCP system. The self-contained nature of the solution ensures easy deployment while maintaining the robust multi-agent architecture for website cloning and iterative improvement.
